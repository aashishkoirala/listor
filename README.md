#### By [Aashish Koirala](http://aashishkoirala.github.io)

A very light-weight list-maker application. I built this for personal use, but you're more than welcome to use it too. Hosted at [aklistor.com](https://www.aklistor.com). It lets you create lists of things, and cross them off as you need to. You can share and collaborate on lists as well. This application is ideal for grocery lists, shopping lists, invitee lists and other scenarios where you need checklists.

#### Features
